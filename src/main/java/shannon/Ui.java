 * The words the chatbot says, and the terminal it says them in.

 * The class has two jobs, kept deliberately apart:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the {@code get...Message} methods <em>build</em> a reply and hand it back as a string;
 *       they touch neither the screen nor the keyboard.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #readCommand()}, {@link #showLine()}, {@link #showLogo()} and
 *       {@link #showMessage(String)} are the only places that talk to the terminal.</li>
 * </ul>
 * That split is what lets the same chatbot run in two skins. The terminal version reads a line
 * and prints the message it gets back; the JavaFX window asks for exactly the same message and
 * puts it in a dialog bubble instead. Neither the tasks nor the commands know the difference.
