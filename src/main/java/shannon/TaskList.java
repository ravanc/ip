/**
 * The list of tasks, and the operations that change it.
 * <p>
 * Wrapping the {@link ArrayList} keeps the list and the rule protecting it together: every command
 * that names a task ({@code mark}, {@code unmark}, {@code delete}) must check that the number
 * refers to a real task, and here that check cannot be skipped, because the only way in is through
 * a method that performs it.
 * <p>
 * {@link #getTasks(int...)} and {@link #deleteTasks(int...)} take the numbers the user typed,
 * counting from 1, not positions counting from 0 &mdash; hence those names rather than
 * {@code get}/{@code remove}, which a reader would rightly expect to be zero-based. Both are
 * varargs, so one method serves {@code delete 2} and {@code delete 2 5 7} alike; the alternative,
 * an overload taking a single {@code int} beside one taking a list, would be two methods that must
 * be kept saying the same thing.
