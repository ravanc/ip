 * E | 0 | project meeting | 2026-08-06 14:00 | 2026-08-06 16:00

 * The first field is the task type, the second is {@code 1} for done and {@code 0} for not done.
 * Fields are escaped by {@link Task#escape(String)} so that a description containing a {@code |}

 * just means a first run. A file that cannot be fully loaded is copied to a backup, e.g.
 * {@code duke.txt.bak}, before the next save rewrites it, so the tasks that could not be read
